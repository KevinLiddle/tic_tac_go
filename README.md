# Tic-tac-Go(lang)
I'm just fartin' around with Go. You can play tic-tac-toe if you want to.

## To play

1. Install a compatible version of Go. I use `asdf` and the [asdf-golang](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-golang) plugin, which reads the Go version from the [go.mod](go.mod) file.
1. `go run .` OR `go build`, then run the `tic_tac_go` executable that is created.
1. Follow the prompts.
